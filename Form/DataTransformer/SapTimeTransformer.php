     * This method is called when {@link Form::submit()} is called to transform the requests tainted data
     * into an acceptable format.
     *
     * The same transformers are called in the reverse order so the responsibility is to
     * return one of the types that would be expected as input of transform().
     *
     * This method must be able to deal with empty values. Usually this will
     * be an empty string, but depending on your implementation other empty
     * values are possible as well (such as NULL). The reasoning behind
     * this is that value transformers must be chainable. If the
     * reverseTransform() method of the first value transformer outputs an
     * empty string, the second value transformer must be able to process that
     * value.
     *
     * By convention, reverseTransform() should return NULL if an empty string
     * is passed.
